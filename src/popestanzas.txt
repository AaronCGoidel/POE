Shut, shut the door, good John! fatigu'd, I said, 
Tie up the knocker, say I'm sick, I'm dead. 
The dog-star rages! nay 'tis past a doubt, 
All Bedlam, or Parnassus, is let out: 
Fire in each eye, and papers in each hand, 
They rave, recite, and madden round the land. 

       What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide? 
They pierce my thickets, through my grot they glide; 
By land, by water, they renew the charge; 
They stop the chariot, and they board the barge. 
No place is sacred, not the church is free; 
Ev'n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me: 
Then from the Mint walks forth the man of rhyme, 
Happy! to catch me just at dinner-time. 

       Is there a parson, much bemus'd in beer, 
A maudlin poetess, a rhyming peer, 
A clerk, foredoom'd his father's soul to cross, 
Who pens a stanza, when he should engross? 
Is there, who, lock'd from ink and paper, scrawls 
With desp'rate charcoal round his darken'd walls? 
All fly to Twit'nam, and in humble strain 
Apply to me, to keep them mad or vain. 
Arthur, whose giddy son neglects the laws, 
Imputes to me and my damn'd works the cause: 
Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope, 
And curses wit, and poetry, and Pope.
