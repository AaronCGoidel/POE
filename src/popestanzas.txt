What beck'ning ghost, along the moon-light shade 
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade? 
'Tis she!â€”but why that bleeding bosom gor'd, 
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword? 
Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell, 
Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well? 
To bear too tender, or too firm a heart, 
To act a lover's or a Roman's part? 
Is there no bright reversion in the sky, 
For those who greatly think, or bravely die?
